# WordPuzzle(DucksGame)

A prototype word game created for fun. Named after my sisters preferred nickname, Duck.

This simple prototype was a project i took on and completed rather quickly simply because my sister showed me the game she was playing on her phone and my only thought was "I could make that".
it is a very simple program which reads from a text file and displays, on a GUI create with tkinter, an encoded version of the phrase selected for the user to decipher.
